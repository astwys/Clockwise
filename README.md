#Get Clockwise up and running

To get Clockwise up and running you will have to download Node.js as well as PostgreSQL
After doing that type "createdb clockwise" in your terminal. This will create a new empty database.
Then you can start the PostgreSQL server.
In a terminal window go to the Clockwise folder and type "npm install".
When the installation is finished type "npm start".
This will start the server and print out the address from which you will be able to view Clockwise.
